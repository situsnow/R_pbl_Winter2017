Author: "Doogan, C.(2017)."
Date: "June 2017."

# This week we are going to go through more ggplot2 uses  with example of when to use each of these tools. 
# The following is bar graphing example from 'The R Cookbook' chang, W. (2016).

# The examples below will the ToothGrowth dataset. Note that dose is a numeric column here;
# in some situations it may be useful to convert it to a factor.

library(ggplot2)

### Titles 
# An example graph without a title:
bp <- ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x=group, y=weight)) + geom_boxplot()
bp

# With a title:
bp + ggtitle("Plant growth")
# Equivalent to
# bp + labs(title="Plant growth")

# If the title is long, it can be split into multiple lines with \n
bp + ggtitle("Plant growth with\ndifferent treatments")

# Reduce line spacing and use bold text
bp + ggtitle("Plant growth with\ndifferent treatments") + theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold"))


### Axes
# Note: In the examples below, where it says something like scale_y_continuous, scale_x_continuous, or ylim,
# the y can be replaced with x if you want to operate on the other axis.

# This is the basic boxplot that we will work with, using the built-in PlantGrowth data set.
bp <- ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x=group, y=weight)) + geom_boxplot()
bp

# Swap x and y axes (make x vertical, y horizontal):
bp + coord_flip()

# Discrete axis
# Changing the order of items

# Manually set the order of a discrete-valued axis
bp + scale_x_discrete(limits=c("trt1","trt2","ctrl"))

# Reverse the order of a discrete-valued axis
# Get the levels of the factor
flevels <- levels(PlantGrowth$group)
flevels
#> [1] "ctrl" "trt1" "trt2"

# Reverse the order
flevels <- rev(flevels)
flevels
#> [1] "trt2" "trt1" "ctrl"

bp + scale_x_discrete(limits=flevels)

# Or it can be done in one line:
bp + scale_x_discrete(limits = rev(levels(PlantGrowth$group)))

# Continous axis 
# Setting range and reversing direction of an axis
# If you simply want to make sure that an axis includes a particular value in the range, 
# use expand_limits(). This can only expand the range of an axis; it can�t shrink the range.

# Make sure to include 0 in the y axis
bp + expand_limits(y=0)

# Make sure to include 0 and 8 in the y axis
bp + expand_limits(y=c(0,8))

# You can also explicitly set the y limits.
# Note that if any scale_y_continuous command is used, it overrides any ylim command, and the ylim will be ignored.

# Set the range of a continuous-valued axis
# These are equivalent
bp + ylim(0, 8)

# If the y range is reduced using the method above, the data outside the range is ignored. This might be OK for a scatterplot, but it can be problematic for the box plots used here. For bar graphs, if the range does not include 0, the bars will not show at all!
# To avoid this problem, you can use coord_cartesian instead. Instead of setting the limits of the data,
# it sets the viewing area of the data.

# These two do the same thing; all data points outside the graphing range are
# dropped, resulting in a misleading box plot
bp + ylim(5, 7.5)
#> Warning: Removed 13 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot).
# bp + scale_y_continuous(limits=c(5, 7.5))

# Using coord_cartesian "zooms" into the area
bp + coord_cartesian(ylim=c(5, 7.5))

# Specify tick marks directly
bp + coord_cartesian(ylim=c(5, 7.5)) + scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 10, 0.25))  # Ticks from 0-10, every .25
# bp + scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0, 8))

### Legends
# start with an example graph with the default options:
bp <- ggplot(data=PlantGrowth, aes(x=group, y=weight, fill=group)) + geom_boxplot()
bp

# Removing legends
# Use guides(fill=FALSE), replacing fill with the desired aesthetic.
# You can also remove all the legends in a graph, using theme.

# Remove legend for a particular aesthetic (fill)
bp + guides(fill=FALSE)

# It can also be done when specifying the scale
bp + scale_fill_discrete(guide=FALSE)

# This removes all legends
bp + theme(legend.position="none")

# Changing the order of the legends
# This changes the order of items to trt1, ctrl, trt2:
bp + scale_fill_discrete(breaks=c("trt1","ctrl","trt2"))

# Reversing the order of the legends
# To reverse the legend order:

# These two methods are equivalent:
bp + guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse=TRUE))
bp + scale_fill_discrete(guide = guide_legend(reverse=TRUE))

### Using scales
# You can also modify the scale directly:
bp + scale_fill_discrete(breaks = rev(levels(PlantGrowth$group)))

# The legend can be a guide for fill, colour, linetype, shape, or other aesthetics.
# With fill and color
# Because group, the variable in the legend, is mapped to the color fill,
# it is necessary to use scale_fill_xxx, where xxx is a method of mapping each factor level of group 
# to different colors. The default is to use a different hue on the color wheel for each factor level,
# but it is also possible to manually specify the colors for each level.

bp + scale_fill_discrete(name="Experimental\nCondition")

bp + scale_fill_discrete(name="Experimental\nCondition", breaks=c("ctrl", "trt1", "trt2"),labels=c("Control", "Treatment 1", "Treatment 2"))

# Using a manual scale instead of hue
bp + scale_fill_manual(values=c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9"), name="Experimental\nCondition",breaks=c("ctrl", "trt1", "trt2"),labels=c("Control", "Treatment 1", "Treatment 2"))

# If you use a line graph, you will probably need to use scale_colour_xxx and/or scale_shape_xxx instead of scale_fill_xxx. 
# colour maps to the colors of lines and points, while fill maps to the color of area fills. shape maps to the shapes of points.
# We�ll use a different data set for the line graphs here because the PlantGrowth data set does not work well with a line graph.

# A different data set
df1 <- data.frame(sex = factor(c("Female","Female","Male","Male")), time = factor(c("Lunch","Dinner","Lunch","Dinner"), levels=c("Lunch","Dinner")), total_bill = c(13.53, 16.81, 16.24, 17.42))

# A basic graph
lp <- ggplot(data=df1, aes(x=time, y=total_bill, group=sex, shape=sex)) + geom_line() + geom_point()
lp

# Change the legend
lp + scale_shape_discrete(name  ="Payer",breaks=c("Female", "Male"),labels=c("Woman", "Man"))

# If you use both colour and shape, they both need to be given scale specifications. Otherwise there will be two two separate legends.

# Specify colour and shape
lp1 <- ggplot(data=df1, aes(x=time, y=total_bill, group=sex, shape=sex, colour=sex)) + geom_line() + geom_point()
lp1

# Here's what happens if you just specify colour
lp1 + scale_colour_discrete(name  ="Payer",breaks=c("Female", "Male"),labels=c("Woman", "Man"))

# Specify both colour and shape
lp1 + scale_colour_discrete(name  ="Payer",breaks=c("Female", "Male"),labels=c("Woman", "Man")) +scale_shape_discrete(name  ="Payer", breaks=c("Female", "Male"),labels=c("Woman", "Man"))

# # Basic line graph
ggplot(data=dat, aes(x=time, y=total_bill, group=1)) + geom_line()
## This would have the same result as above
# ggplot(data=dat, aes(x=time, y=total_bill)) +
#     geom_line(aes(group=1))

# Add points
ggplot(data=dat, aes(x=time, y=total_bill, group=1)) + geom_line() + geom_point()

# Change color of both line and points
# Change line type and point type, and use thicker line and larger points
# Change points to circles with white fill
ggplot(data=dat, aes(x=time, y=total_bill, group=1)) + geom_line(colour="red", linetype="dashed", size=1.5) + geom_point(colour="red", size=4, shape=21, fill="white")

# Change the y-range to go from 0 to the maximum value in the total_bill column,
# and change axis labels
ggplot(data=dat, aes(x=time, y=total_bill, group=1)) + geom_line() +geom_point() + expand_limits(y=0) + xlab("Time of day") + ylab("Total bill") + ggtitle("Average bill for 2 people")

### Graphs with more variables
dat1 <- data.frame( sex = factor(c("Female","Female","Male","Male")), time = factor(c("Lunch","Dinner","Lunch","Dinner"), levels=c("Lunch","Dinner")), total_bill = c(13.53, 16.81, 16.24, 17.42))
dat1
#>      sex   time total_bill
#> 1 Female  Lunch      13.53
#> 2 Female Dinner      16.81
#> 3   Male  Lunch      16.24
#> 4   Male Dinner      17.42

### Bar Graphs
# Stacked bar graph -- this is probably not what you want
ggplot(data=dat1, aes(x=time, y=total_bill, fill=sex)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")

# Bar graph, time on x-axis, color fill grouped by sex -- use position_dodge()
ggplot(data=dat1, aes(x=time, y=total_bill, fill=sex)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge())

ggplot(data=dat1, aes(x=time, y=total_bill, fill=sex)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge(), colour="black")

# Change colors
ggplot(data=dat1, aes(x=time, y=total_bill, fill=sex)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge(), colour="black") + scale_fill_manual(values=c("#999999", "#E69F00"))

# It�s easy to change which variable is mapped the x-axis and which is mapped to the fill.

# Bar graph, time on x-axis, color fill grouped by sex -- use position_dodge()
ggplot(data=dat1, aes(x=sex, y=total_bill, fill=time)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge(), colour="black")

# These are the variable mappings used here:
# time: x-axis
# sex: line color
# total_bill: y-axis.
# To draw multiple lines, the points must be grouped by a variable; otherwise all points will be connected by a single line. 
# In this case, we want them to be grouped by sex.

# Basic line graph with points
ggplot(data=dat1, aes(x=time, y=total_bill, group=sex)) + geom_line() + geom_point()

# Map sex to color
ggplot(data=dat1, aes(x=time, y=total_bill, group=sex, colour=sex)) + geom_line() + geom_point()

# Map sex to different point shape, and use larger points
ggplot(data=dat1, aes(x=time, y=total_bill, group=sex, shape=sex)) + geom_line() + geom_point()


# Use thicker lines and larger points, and hollow white-filled points
ggplot(data=dat1, aes(x=time, y=total_bill, group=sex, shape=sex)) +  geom_line(size=1.5) +  geom_point(size=3, fill="white") + scale_shape_manual(values=c(22,21))

# It�s easy to change which variable is mapped the x-axis and which is mapped to the color or shape.
ggplot(data=dat1, aes(x=sex, y=total_bill, group=time, shape=time, color=time)) + geom_line() + geom_point()

### With a numeric x-axis
# When the variable on the x-axis is numeric, it is sometimes useful to treat it as continuous, and sometimes useful to 
# treat it as categorical. In this data set, the dose is a numeric variable with values 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0.
# It might be useful to treat these values as equal categories when making a graph.

datn <- read.table(header=TRUE, text='
                   supp dose length
                   OJ  0.5  13.23
                   OJ  1.0  22.70
                   OJ  2.0  26.06
                   VC  0.5   7.98
                   VC  1.0  16.77
                   VC  2.0  26.14
                   ')

### With x-axis treated as continuous
# A simple graph might put dose on the x-axis as a numeric value. 
# It is possible to make a line graph this way, but not a bar graph.

ggplot(data=datn, aes(x=dose, y=length, group=supp, colour=supp)) + geom_line() + geom_point()

### With x-axis treated as categorical

# If you wish to treat it as a categorical variable instead of a numeric one, 
# it must be converted to a factor. This can be done by modifying the data frame, 
# or by changing the specification of the graph.

# Copy the data frame and convert dose to a factor
datn2 <- datn
datn2$dose <- factor(datn2$dose)
ggplot(data=datn2, aes(x=dose, y=length, group=supp, colour=supp)) + geom_line() + geom_point()

# Use the original data frame, but put factor() directly in the plot specification
ggplot(data=datn, aes(x=factor(dose), y=length, group=supp, colour=supp)) + geom_line() + geom_point()

### It is also possible to make a bar graph when the variable is treated as categorical rather than numeric.

# Use datn2 from above
ggplot(data=datn2, aes(x=dose, y=length, fill=supp)) +  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge())

# Use the original data frame, but put factor() directly in the plot specification
ggplot(data=datn, aes(x=factor(dose), y=length, fill=supp)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge())
