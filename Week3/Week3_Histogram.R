# This week we are going to go through more ggplot2 uses  with example of when to use each of these tools. 
# Example from 'The R Cookbook' chang, W. (2016).

### Histograms and density plots
# Some sample data: these two vectors contain 200 data points each:

set.seed(1234)
rating  <- rnorm(200)
head(rating)
#> [1] -1.2070657  0.2774292  1.0844412 -2.3456977  0.4291247  0.5060559

rating2 <- rnorm(200, mean=.8)
head(rating2)
#> [1] 1.2852268 1.4967688 0.9855139 1.5007335 1.1116810 1.5604624

# When plotting multiple groups of data, some graphing routines require a data frame with one column 
# for the grouping variable and one for the measure variable.

# Make a column to indicate which group each value is in
cond <- factor( rep(c("A","B"), each=200) )

data <- data.frame(cond, rating = c(rating,rating2))
head(data)
#>   cond     rating
#> 1    A -1.2070657
#> 2    A  0.2774292
#> 3    A  1.0844412
#> 4    A -2.3456977
#> 5    A  0.4291247
#> 6    A  0.5060559

# # Histogram
hist(rating)

# Use 8 bins (this is only approximate - it places boundaries on nice round numbers)
# Make it light blue #CCCCFF
# Instead of showing count, make area sum to 1, (freq=FALSE)
hist(rating, breaks=8, col="#CCCCFF", freq=FALSE)

# Put breaks at every 0.6
boundaries <- seq(-3, 3.6, by=.6)
boundaries
#>  [1] -3.0 -2.4 -1.8 -1.2 -0.6  0.0  0.6  1.2  1.8  2.4  3.0  3.6

hist(rating, breaks=boundaries)


# Kernel density plot
plot(density(rating))
