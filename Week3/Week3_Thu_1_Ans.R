# Go ahead and run the following, so you do not have to re-do everything previously.

# "Module 1  Introduction to R - Week 1 Working with Data Summary."
### Install packages
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

### Read data
ti_train<- read.csv("titanic_train_week1.csv",na.strings=c("NA","NaN", ""), header = TRUE, sep=",")
ti_test<- read.csv("titanic_test_week1.csv",na.strings=c("NA","NaN", ""), header = TRUE, sep = ",")

### Investigating the  data frame
# Train data
str(ti_train)
summary(ti_train)
# Test data
str(ti_train)
summary(ti_test)

### Resolving mismatched variable length
colnames_check <- colnames(ti_train) %in% colnames(ti_test) 
colnames(ti_train[colnames_check==FALSE])
# 'Survived' was printed, this means that survived is the missing variable in the test set. 

### Check for NA's
# training data
ti_train[!complete.cases(ti_train),]
ti_test[!complete.cases(ti_test),]

### Addressing 'Cabin' NA's
# training data
ti_train<- select(ti_train, -Cabin)
head(ti_train)
# testing data
ti_test<- select(ti_test, -Cabin)
head(ti_test)

### Addressing ' Age' NA's
# training data
ti_train$Age[is.na(ti_train$Age)] <- mean(ti_train$Age, na.rm = TRUE)
dplyr::filter(ti_train, is.na(Age))
# testing data
ti_test$Age[is.na(ti_test$Age)] <- mean(ti_test$Age, na.rm = TRUE)
dplyr::filter(ti_test, is.na(Age))

### Addressing ' Embarked' NA's
# training data
prop.table(table(ti_train$Embarked))
ti_train$Embarked <- replace(ti_train$Embarked, which(is.na(ti_train$Embarked)), 'S')
sum(is.na(ti_train$Embarked))
# testing data
prop.table(table(ti_test$Embarked))
ti_test$Embarked <- replace(ti_test$Embarked, which(is.na(ti_test$Embarked)), 'S')
sum(is.na(ti_test$Embarked))

### Addressing 'Fare' NA's
# testing data
ti_test$Fare[is.na(ti_test$Fare)] <- mean(ti_test$Fare, na.rm = TRUE)
dplyr::filter(ti_test, is.na(Fare))

# Now we will do some data exploration.....with ggplot2

# First we will check in on how many people survived. To refresh our memory.
table(ti_train$Survived)
#   0   1 
# 549 342 

# To see this as a proportion:
survived_all<-filter(ti_train,Survived==1)
# We know how to see this information using head()
head(survived_all)

# To view survived as a proportion
prop.table(table(ti_train$Survive))
# 0         1 
# 0.6161616 0.3838384

# Challenge 1: Do you think that this indicates that the survival rate was random? Why?
#  Answer: 
# 61% of passengers died. If it were random, it would probably be closer to 50% survived, and 50% died. 
# So without even looking at some more statistically sound methods
# we can say that the survival rate is not due to chance. 

# We should look further into what is going on.
# head() didn't give us much information. We could try summary()
summary(survived_all)
# That is a lot better. Now we know that:
# 233 females survived, and 109 males survived. 
# The mean age of survival was 28, the youngest was a baby, and the oldest was 80.
# The mean number of  siblings a surviving passenger had was 0.47 
# and the median class that people who survived were 2.


# Some of these results are surprising, so require further explanation. 
# Challenge 2: Why is this method for summarising what variable impact survival be wrong?
# Answer:
# We only know the raw values, not the proportions to the number of people who did not survive. 

# Challenge 3: Calculate the proportion of passangers surviving in each class.
# Answer:
prop.table(table(ti_train$Pclass, ti_train$Survived),1)
# 1st Class 62.9%
# 2nd Class 47.3%
# 3rd Class 24.2%

# Not to get an idea of the proportion of survived:Died for the variable class we can do a split bar graph like so.
# First create factors
total <- ti_train
total$Pclass <- factor(total$Pclass)
levels(total$Pclass) <- c("First Class", "Second Class", "Third Class")
total$Survived <- factor(total$Survived)
# Now plot per factor
ggplot(total, aes(Pclass)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = Survived)) + ggtitle("Class as the Survival Factor")

# Did 62.9% of 1st class passengers seem small to you?
# Since the fare is related to the class, 
# we should see if the fare impacts the impact of survival within the classes.
# It is often easier to graph this. 
# Using qplot to graph these proportions. 
# qplot is a quick version of ggplot2.
qplot(Age, Fare, data=ti_train, colour=as.factor(Sex))
# It looks like the fare effects the passenger survival, particularly in the 1st class. 
# This is our first hint that there are relationships between variables. We will note this for further exploration later.

# Now lets look at the sex variable. 
# Challenge 4: Find the proportion of survived:died for sex
# Answer:
prop.table(table(ti_train$Sex, ti_train$Survived),1)
# Female 74.2%
# Male 18.9%

# Challenge 5: Plot the proportion of survived for each sex.
# Answer:
# First create factors
total_sex <- ti_train
total_sex$Sex <- factor(total_sex$Sex)
levels(total_sex$Sex) <- c("First Class", "Second Class", "Third Class")
total_sex$Survived <- factor(total_sex$Survived)
# Now plot per factor
ggplot(total, aes(Sex)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = Survived)) + ggtitle("Sex as the Survival Factor")

# Let's have a  look at age.
# Challenge 6: Examine the proportions of survived: died for the Age variable.
# Answer:
prop.table(table(ti_train$Age, ti_train$Survived),1)
# Why was this unhelpful?

# This is what can happen when you look at continous data on a bar graph.
barchart_Age <- ggplot(ti_train, aes(as.factor(Age), fill=as.factor(Survived)))+geom_bar()

barchart_Age+xlab("Passenger Age")+ylab("Number of Passengers")+ggtitle("Survival by Age")+scale_fill_discrete(name = "", labels = c("Died", "Survived"))
# Maybe it's the the messiness of the x-axis.
# Remove the numbers
barchart_Age+ scale_x_discrete(name = "Age", breaks = NULL)

# With continous data it is oftern easier to grooup the vales into initervals. 
# Here, we group the passangers by junouirs (under 14),Aductkts (14> but <40) and sesniors (>40).
# Add the variable of age group to differentiate juniors and seniors
total$AgeG <- ifelse(total$Age > 14 | is.na(total$Age), 2, 1)
total$AgeG <- ifelse(total$Age < 40 | is.na(total$Age), total$AgeG, 3)
total$AgeG <- factor(total$AgeG)
levels(total$AgeG) <- c("Junior", "Adult", "Senior")
ggplot(total, aes(AgeG)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = Survived)) + ggtitle("Age as the Survival Factor")

# Have a look at the family size as the survival factor.
ggplot(total, aes(factor(SibSp + Parch + 1))) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Survived)) + 
  facet_wrap(~Sex+Pclass, nrow = 2, scales = "free") + 
  ggtitle("Family Size as the Survival Factor")


# Challenge 7: Family size is another variable that we should catagorise. 
# Catagorise the family size by adding the SibSp to the Parch variable.
# Answer:
# *Hint* use a similar process to catgorising age.
total$FamilySize <- ifelse((total$SibSp + total$Parch + 1) == 1, 1, 2)
total$FamilySize <- ifelse((total$SibSp + total$Parch + 1) >= 4, 3, total$FamilySize)
total$FamilySize <- factor(total$FamilySize)
levels(total$FamilySize) <- c("Alone", "SFamily", "BFamily")


# Time to start analysisng the relationship between variables.
# Lets look at Age and sex together. 
ggplot(na.omit(total), aes(Age)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = Survived), binwidth = 2) + 
  facet_wrap(~Sex+Pclass, nrow = 2, scales = "free_y") + 
  ggtitle("Age as the Survival Factor")

ggplot(total, aes(x = SibSp + Parch + 1, y = Fare)) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(colour = Survived)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  facet_wrap(~Sex+Pclass, nrow = 2, scales = "free") +
