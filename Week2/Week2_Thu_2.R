  # Humans are visual creatures, and it is much easier to see a graphical representation when working with data than to post a bunch of numbers on a screen.
  # For this reason we are going to be learning how to visualise data in R at the same time as conducting an exploratory statistical analysis. 
  # ggplot2 is the later in R visualisation packaging. It is far more superior than older scripting methods, and you should adopt this package as your go-to rather than other methods. 
  # Although ggplot2 is fantastic for in-depth visualisation, some of the more basic methods are fine to use when starting off. ggplot2 incorporates these in-built functions you will see. 
  # *Note* some MDS units do not teach ggplot2 but accept theIR use in assessments  (and tutors even enjoy looking at them more!).However, as some markers may not be as familiar with
  # ggplot2 as other methods, you should make sure that your comments are concise but helpful in explaining your rationale. 
  
  
  # Install packages
  install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Import data

gapminder <- read.csv("gapminder-FiveYearData.csv", header = TRUE)

### Base Plotting
# Base R provide convince ways to quickly generate graphics. The primary functions include:
# Here we will use the mtcars dataset to have a look at these functions. 
# First we need to see what variables we have so we call dim() and summary()
dim(mtcars)
# This is a data frame with 32 observations on 11 variables.
# The search function of the Help tab in the Environment window is used to find out what these variables mean.
# *Note* In some MDS units, explanations of what the variables are may not be given. You must assess the features of this data to get an understanding of how to manipulate it.
# This is a key aspect of working with data in data science.
# From the help function we learn that the variables in mtcars are:
# [, 1]     mpg     Miles/(US) gallon
# [, 2]     cyl     Number of cylinders
# [, 3]     disp     Displacement (cu.in.)
# [, 4]     hp     Gross horsepower
# [, 5]     drat     Rear axle ratio
# [, 6]     wt     Weight (1000 lbs)
# [, 7]     qsec     1/4 mile time
# [, 8]     vs     V/S
# [, 9]     am     Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
# [,10]     gear     Number of forward gears
# [,11]     carb     Number of carburettors

# Challenge 1: Recall what [,1] means.
# 
# (Type you answer here)
#
#

# This is observed when we call the summary() function. 
summary(mtcars)
# Using summary we see that the data is quite varied. Our first goal is to determine what type of data this is, e.g., continuous, discrete, categorical, binary, etc.
# For an overview of the statistical data type.
# We see that there is a lot of what looks like numerical continuous (mpg, disp, drat, wt, qsec), numerical discrete (cyl, hp, gear), categorical nominal (vs, am).

# To make sure we are right though. We can inspect using the pairs() function:
pairs(mtcars)

# plot: make scatter plot
# We investigate the gears variable which we are not sure is categorical or numerical
plot(mtcars$gear)
# We should do this as a frequency
tab_gears<-table(mtcars$gear)
plot(tab_gears)

# It is probably discrete, but we cannot be sure.
# The rest of the functions are:

# lines: add lines to plot
# points: add points to plot
# text: add text
# title: add title to axes or plot
# mtext: add margin text
# axis: add axis tick/labels
# hist: make a histogram
# box: make a histogram
# Using these functions, plotting features can be specified using following parameters:
# pch: plotting symbol
# lty: line type
# lwd: line width
# col: plotting colour
# las: orientation of axis labels
# bg: background color
# mar: margin size
# oma: outer margin size
# mfrow: number of plots per row, column. Plots filled in row-wise.
# mfcol: number of plots per row, column. Plots filled in column-wise.
# xlab: a title for the x axis
# ylab: a title for the y axis: see title.

# Working on gapminder:

### Plotting : plot()
# Look at the life expectancy 
plot (gapminder$lifeExp)
# It is very difficult to look at and infer anything about the data. We can present
# the data by year and we will only look at the mean.
life_exp_year<-gapminder %>% group_by (year) %>% summarise(mean_lifeExp=mean(lifeExp))
plot(life_exp_year)
# Add some lables
plot(life_exp_year, xlab="Year", ylab="Life expectancy")


# Boxplots: box()
# making a boxplot with GDP
boxplot(gapminder$gdpPercap, ylab="GDP per capita")
# That looks horrible. We can fiX it using boxwex= a scaling factor to make boxes narrower or wider and log= to scale . 
boxplot(gapminder$gdpPercap, ylab="GDP per capita", boxwex =1,log = "y" )
# Change the colour of the boxplot with col= and the border with border=
boxplot(gapminder$gdpPercap, ylab="GDP per capita", boxwex =1,log = "y", col="red", border="Blue" )

# We used group_by() to get the mean using the summarize() functions. But a simple way when just wanting to 
# display data by another variable is to use ~ e.g. gdpPercap ~ year
# Challenge 2: Create a boxplot of life expectancy by continent
# Answer:
boxplot(lifeExp~continent, data=gapminder, ylab="Life expectancy")

### ggplot2 
# All of those functions can be called on different graph types
# e.g plot(), hist(), bar() etc. But ggplot2 can be thought of as a way to use those graph types with add ons to 
# make the functions look more visually pleasing.
# ggplot2 is an advanced plotting package, which is increased due to its efficiency and flexibility.
#here does the �gg� in ggplot2 come from? The ggplot2 package provides an R implementation of Leland Wilkinson�s Grammar of Graphics (1999).
# The Grammar of Graphics allows you to think beyond the garden variety plot types (e.g. scatter plot, bar plot) and the 
# consider the components that make up a plot or graphic, such as how data are represented on the plot (as lines, points, etc.),
# how variables are mapped to coordinates or plotting shape or color, what transformation or statistical summary is required,
# and so on.the idea that any plot can be expressed from the same set of components: 
# a data set, a coordinate system, and a set of geoms�the visual representation of data points.
# The key to understanding ggplot2 is thinking about a figure in layers.
# This idea may be familiar to you if you have used image editing programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, or Inkscape.

# Specifically, ggplot2 allows you to build a plot layer-by-layer by specifying:
# a geom, which specifies how the data are represented on the plot (points, lines, bars, etc.),
# aesthetics that map variables in the data to axes on the plot or plotting size, shape, colour, etc.,
# a stat, a statistical transformation or summary of the data applied before plotting,
# facets, which we�ve already seen above that allow the data to be divided into chunks by other categorical 
# or continuous variables and the same plot drawn for each piece.

# The commonly used plotting functions include:
# geom_point: for scatter plot
# geom_line: for line plot.
# geom_bar: for bar plot
# geom_histogram: for histogram
# geom_boxplot: for boxplot
# geom_density: for smoothed density plot

# If we want to plit a continous variable X by continous variable Y we can use a scatterplot.
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point()
# We are telling ggplot2 to go and user the gapminder dataset
# Then use aesthetic mapping to map the gdpPerCap data onto the x axis and the lifeExp onto the y axis. 
# We use geom_point() to to specificy the geometric object that needs to be ploted (there are many types).
# We can add lables and then change the size of the points using size().
# We can also modify the transparency of the points, using the alpha function,
# which is especially helpful when you have a large amount of data which is very clustered.
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point( size = 2,alpha = 0.5)+  xlab("GDP per capita")+ ylab("Life expectancy")

# It is hard to see what is happening so we can add some colour. Here we tell ggplot to plot
# the data by continent
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_point( size = 2,alpha = 0.5)+
  xlab("GDP per capita")+
  ylab("Life expectancy")
# It is still hard to see what is happening because of all the ouliers.
# So now we can change the scale of the data using the scale_log_10() function.
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_point( size = 2,alpha = 0.5)+
  xlab("GDP per capita")+
  ylab("Life expectancy")+
  scale_x_log10()
# The log10 function applied a transformation to the values of the gdpPercap column before rendering them on the plot,
# so that each multiple of 10 now only corresponds to an increase in 1 on the transformed scale,
# e.g. a GDP per capita of 1,000 is now 3 on the y axis, a value of 10,000 corresponds to 4 on the y axis and so on.
# This makes it easier to visualize the spread of data on the x-axis.

# Challenge 2: Create a density plot of GDP per capita, 
# filled by continent.Transform the x axis to better visualise the data spread.
#  
#
# (Type you answer here)
#
#

# This is very helpful for comparing distributions.

# plot() and pairs() is used to see multi-pannel graphs of variables.
pairs(gapminder)
plot(gapminder$lifeExp,gapminder$country)
# But ggplot2 has a nicer way:
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point( size = 1,alpha = 0.5)+
  xlab("GDP per capita")+
  ylab("Life expectancy") +
  facet_wrap( ~ continent) +
  scale_x_log10()

# Challange 3:Add a facet layer to panel the previous density plots by year.
