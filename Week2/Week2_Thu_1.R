  # This week we will be focusing on basic data exploration. However, we first need to learn about control flow. 
  # This is fundamental to most programming languages and allows us to make conditions. 
  # Since we have packages such as dplr though, we don't need to know any more than the basics.
  # We will cover control structures in session 2 this week.
  
  # Install packages
  install.packages("dyplr")
library(dplyr)

# Import data
gapminder <- read.csv("gapminder-FiveYearData.csv", header = TRUE)

### select()
# We use select when we only want to work with a few of the variables in our dataset. 
year_country_gdp <- select(gapminder,year,country,gdpPercap)

# Having a look shows that we only have the year, the country and the GDP as a percentage.
head(year_country_gdp)

# Challenge 1: We wrote this code without using any pipes (%>%). Why should we consider using pipes?
# Answer:
# Pipes allow us to save time writting (and reduce syntax errors), aid R in running large data sets faster and imporve the readability of the code. 

# This is the same code but with pipes.
year_country_gdp <- gapminder %>% select(year,country,gdpPercap)

# What did we just write?
# Challenge 2: Translate the above code with pipes into English step-by-step.
# Answer:
# Take the gapminder data set and then pipe it to call the select function on it so that only the 
# year, country and GDP per capita are going to be stored in a new variable called year_country_gdp.


### filter()
# We use filter() when we want to do something with only a portion of the data that meets a condition.
# Filter is similar to our conditional statements.
# In this example we only want to get data from our newly selected data frame, that is from continental Europe.
year_country_gdp_euro <- gapminder %>% filter(continent=="Europe") %>% select(year,country,gdpPercap)

# Challenge 3: Write a code that will produce a dataframe that has 
# the values for lifeExp, country and year for African countires only.
# How many rows does your dataframe have and why?
# Answer:
year_country_lifeExp_Africa <- gapminder %>% filter(continent=="Africa") %>% select(year,country,lifeExp)

# Here we have used pipes to pass the gapminder data frame to the filter() function. Then we passed the filtered gapminder 
# data frame to the select() function.
The order of functions here is important. 
#Try swapping the filter() and select() functions around in the above code.
# What is the result? Why has this happened?
# Answer:
year_country_gdp_africa <- gapminder %>%select(year,country,gdpPercap) %>%filter(continent=="Africa")
# This causes a error. 

### group_by() and summarize()

# One of the reasons we use dplyr is because it reduces the repetitiveness of writing code.
# This helps reduced the number of errors we may encounter (because of our typing)
# Let's say we wanted to find out year, countries and life expectancy for each of the continents. 
# This is how we would do that without writing out the same code over and over.
# We don't use filter() to get observations as it would only get the observations
# that meet certain criteria e.g.continent =="Europe".
# Instead we use the group_by() function which allows us to use all the unique criteria that we did in filter(). 
# We make use of str()
str(gapminder)
str(gapminder %>% group_by(continent))
head(gapminder)

# Not much happens with the group_by() function unless it is paired with the summarise function.
# We split our gampminder data frame up using the group_by() function. We now have groups of data for each continent.
# Using summarise(), we can now pass data from the new continent data frames to more functions, e.g., mean, median, etc.
# In this next example, we want to find the mean GDP per capita for each of the continents.
gdp_bycontinents <- gapminder %>% group_by(continent) %>% summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap))
print(gdp_bycontinents)

# Challenge 4: Calculate the average life expectancy per country. 
# Which has the longest average life expectancy and which has the shortest average life expectancy?
# Answer:
lifeExp_bycountry <- gapminder %>% group_by(country) %>% summarize(mean_lifeExp=mean(lifeExp))
lifeExp_bycountry %>% filter(mean_lifeExp == min(mean_lifeExp) | mean_lifeExp == max(mean_lifeExp))
# Iceland 76.51 Year
# Sierra Leone 36.77 Years

### arrange()
# We could do this challenge another way. That is to use dplyrs arrange() function. Using this function, we can
# arrange the rows in a data frame according to the order of any of the variables in the data frame. We can choose more than 
# one variable to arrange the data frame by. It is similar to the sort button in Excel. 
# You can use desc() inside of arrange() arrange(desc()) to order the data in descending order.
lifeExp_bycountry %>% arrange(mean_lifeExp) %>%
  head(1)

# Challenge 5:Rearrange the lifeExp_bycountry in descending order.
# Answer:
lifeExp_bycountry %>% arrange(desc(mean_lifeExp)) %>%
  head(1)

# Using group_by() for multiple variables.
# We can use group_by form more than one variable. In this example we will group by year and continent. 
gdp_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>% group_by(continent,year) %>% summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap))
head(gdp_bycontinents_byyear)

# The advantage of using group_by() is that you can now call functions on multiple variables using summarize.

# Challenge 6: In Challenge 4 you calculated the life expectancy per country.
# Now calculate the GDP by year for each continent and provide the mean and standard deviation *sd()* GDP per capita, 
# and the mean and standard deviation of the population. 
# Answer
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>% group_by(continent,year) %>% summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap),sd_gdpPercap=sd(gdpPercap),mean_pop=mean(pop),sd_pop=sd(pop)
                                                                                    
                                                                                    ### Count() and nd()
                                                                                    # You will be asked to count some observations a lot. dThere are two dplyr functions to do this. 
                                                                                    # Count() is similar to a conditional statement. It will take the specification and match it to all of the data in a column
                                                                                    # The then gives you how many of those observations matched your specification. 
                                                                                    # You can also sort the data at the same time using sort =TRUE.
                                                                                    gapminder %>% filter(year == 2002) %>% count(continent, sort = TRUE)
                                                                                    
                                                                                    # If we wanted to know the number of observations in calculations then we can use n().
                                                                                    #In this example we want to know the standard error of the life expectancy per continent. 
                                                                                    gapminder %>% group_by(continent) %>% summarize(se_pop = sd(lifeExp)/sqrt(n()))
                                                                                    
                                                                                    ### Mutate()
                                                                                    # We can also create new variables prior to (or even after) summarizing information using mutate().
                                                                                    gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>% mutate(gdp_billion=gdpPercap*pop/10^9) %>% group_by(continent,year) %>% summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap), sd_gdpPercap=sd(gdpPercap), mean_pop=mean(pop), sd_pop=sd(pop), mean_gdp_billion=mean(gdp_billion), sd_gdp_billion=sd(gdp_billion))
                                                                                    head(gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear)
                                                                                    
                                                                                    # A lot of what we have covered is relatively advanced in respect to your MDS units, 
                                                                                    # but they are powerful, and we will revisit their use later.
                                                                                    
                                                                                    # End Session.
